  <h1>Hello there, I'm Panagiotis Christias 👋</h1>
</p>

<p align="center">
  I work with data, building projects that bring structure, clarity, and insight out of raw information.  
  For me, data projects are not just about code or queries – they’re about creating something complete and meaningful.  
</p>

<p align="center">
  Just like music, working with data has its own rhythm:  
  <br>• structure,<br>• flow,<br>• and harmony.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Here you’ll find some of my personal and portfolio projects where I experiment, learn, and share what I build.
