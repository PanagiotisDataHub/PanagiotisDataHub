<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Panagiotis Christias ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I work with data, building projects that bring structure, clarity, and insight out of raw information.  
For me, data projects are not just about code or queries â€“ theyâ€™re about creating something complete and meaningful.  

Just like music, working with data has its own rhythm:  
â€¢ structure  
â€¢ flow  
â€¢ harmony  

Here youâ€™ll find some of my personal and portfolio projects where I experiment, learn, and share what I build.
