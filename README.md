# Hello there, I'm Panagiotis Christias 👋

I work with data, building projects that bring structure, clarity, and insight out of raw information.  
For me, data projects are not just about code or queries – they’re about creating something complete and meaningful.

Just like music, working with data has its own rhythm:  
- structure,  
- flow,  
- and harmony.

Here you’ll find some of my personal and portfolio projects where I experiment, learn, and share what I build.
